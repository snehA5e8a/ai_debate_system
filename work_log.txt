- Debate system 
- Moderator Agent
-- Edited the intro prompt - working :heavy-tick:
-- Minor fix - removed 'generating response' text display

- Debate agent
Code space is being displayed - special characters, tokens are being leaked to response
-- Added a response preprocessing function after generating response, before passing to main

Issues
1. Debate agent - opening statement(s) response overflow 
2. Moderator Agent - Not getting the log in between to process or analyse
3. Proponent rebuttal 	and opponent rebuttal: 
   Possible causes:
	- Proponent is not receiving the right/any statement to analyse and oppose to
	- Opponent is receiving its own opening statement to analyse and oppose to
   Or 
	- Need to check the flow in debate system Main arguments and rebuttals 
4. Factchecker result - inconsistent : need to check the flow
