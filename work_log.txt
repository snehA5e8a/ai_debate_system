- Debate system 
- Moderator Agent
-- Edited the intro prompt - working :heavy-tick:
-- Minor fix - removed 'generating response' text display

- Debate agent
Code space is being displayed - special characters, tokens are being leaked to response
-- Added a response preprocessing function after generating response, before passing to main ==> applied to all 

Issues
1. Debate agent - opening statement(s) response overflow 
2. Moderator Agent - Not getting the log in between to process or analyse
3. Proponent rebuttal 	and opponent rebuttal: 
   Possible causes:
	- Proponent is not receiving the right/any statement to analyse and oppose to
	- Opponent is receiving its own opening statement to analyse and oppose to
   Or 
	- Need to check the flow in debate system Main arguments and rebuttals 
4. Factchecker result - inconsistent : need to check the flow

Need to define a base class 
attributes : memory,(not for factchecker) llm, name(optional)
methods : cleanup response
As of now method copied to moderator 

-- 
1. Solution tried: 
Reducing max_tokens to 180 to handle overflow issue and speed up - not worked
Changed the model to Mistral - response improved

Model changed
-------------
1. Overflow issue fixed
4. Factchecker result ok
Loading time increased - bigger model
